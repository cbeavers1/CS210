This project is an application used for calculating interest on an initial investment with or without a monthly deposit in a bank account. I personally thought that I did well at organizing the code but I definitely could have used more conventional names with variables and functions along with leaving more comments. Organizing code helps with readability and maintainability. which I definitely think I have achieved this here. I could definitely add more comments directing someone who doesn't know the code through the process. The most challenging code here was integrating the account classes formulas of calculation into the main function to output correctly. This was a complicated situation but I eventually worked through it after taking a break and thinking it through. This code has helped me understand classes and objects better and how they can help to organize and manipulate code with less complication. Using OOP principles I have organized my code to be maintainable, reusable, and adaptable.
